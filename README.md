# Regional indicator letter

Simple array containing all capital letters in unicode form.

## Why this repository

I was working on a project using Discord.js. I needed to put reactions to messages but I had to copy pasted one by one the capital letter from a website. So I thought it might help other people to have this list of letters directly.
